# Excel-Contacts-Upload-On-Record-Page
This Lightning Web Component allows users to upload an Excel (.xlsx) file containing contact data directly from the Account record page in Salesforce. Once the file is uploaded, it reads the Excel content using the SheetJS (XLSX.js) JavaScript library and inserts the contacts as related records under the current Account using an Apex controller.
